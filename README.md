# 🛡️ Why I Chose Cybersecurity

Hi, I'm **Anikesh Kummar** – a first-year Electrical Engineering student from **Parala Maharaja Engineering College**, Berhampur.

Cybersecurity isn’t just a career path for me — it’s a **calling**.  
I chose this field because it demands **human instinct, creativity, and strategy** — qualities that can’t be easily automated, even by the most powerful AI (yet 😉).

## 💥 My Realizations

- AI can write code.  
- AI can debug systems.  
- But **AI can't think like a hacker** – not truly.  
  It doesn’t understand fear, risk, or unpredictable human behavior.

Cybersecurity is **where human intelligence still leads** the frontlines.  
And that’s exactly why I’m here.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

- I want to learn how systems break — so I can protect and improve them.
- I want to combine **online hacking** (software, networks, Linux) with **physical hacking** (electronics, sensors, circuits).
- I want to protect my country, my people, and digital infrastructure from invisible threats.

## 🤝 This Is Just the Beginning

This repo is my **origin story**.  
As I grow — in skills, understanding, and vision — I’ll keep updating it.  
One day, I’ll not only be a cyber defender —  
I'll help others !
